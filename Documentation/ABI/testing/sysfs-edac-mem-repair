Description:
		The sysfs EDAC bus devices /<dev-name>/mem_repairX subdirectory
		belongs to the memory media repair features control, such as
		PPR (Post Package Repair), memory sparing etc, where<dev-name>
		directory corresponds to a device registered with the EDAC
		device driver for the memory repair features.
		/mem_repairX belongs to either sPPR (Soft PPR) or hPPR (Hard PPR)
		feature of PPR feature, hard or soft memory sparing etc. The memory
		sparing is a repair function that replaces a portion of memory
		(spared memory) with a portion of functional memory. The memory
		sparing has cacheline/row/bank/rank sparing granularities.
		The sysfs memory repair attr nodes would be only present if a
		memory repair feature is supported.

Description:
		(WO) Start the memory repair operation for the memory attributes
		set. Return failure if resources are not available to
		perform repair.
		In some states of system configuration (e.g. before address
		decoders have been configured), memory devices (e.g. CXL)
		may not have an active mapping in the main host address
		physical address map. As such, the memory to repair must be
		identified by a device specific physical addressing scheme
		using a DPA. The DPA to use will be presented in related
		error records.
