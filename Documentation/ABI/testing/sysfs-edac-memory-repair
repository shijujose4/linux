Description:
		The sysfs EDAC bus devices /<dev-name>/mem_repairX subdirectory
		pertains to the memory media repair features control, such as
		PPR (Post Package Repair), memory sparing etc, where<dev-name>
		directory corresponds to a device registered with the EDAC
		device driver for the memory repair features.

		Post Package Repair is a maintenance operation requests the memory
		device to perform a repair operation on its media, in detail is a
		memory self-healing feature that fixes a failing memory location by
		replacing it with a spare row in a DRAM device. For example, a
		CXL memory device with DRAM components that support PPR features may
		implement PPR maintenance operations. DRAM components may support
		two types of PPR functions: hard PPR, for a permanent row repair, and
		soft PPR, for a temporary row repair. soft PPR is much faster than
		hard PPR, but the repair is lost with a power cycle.

		Memory sparing is a repair function that replaces a portion
		of memory with a portion of functional memory at that same
		sparing granularity. Memory sparing has cacheline/row/bank/rank
		sparing granularities. For example, in memory-sparing mode,
		one memory rank serves as a spare for other ranks on the same
		channel in case they fail. The spare rank is held in reserve and
		not used as active memory until a failure is indicated, with
		reserved capacity subtracted from the total available memory
		in the system.The DIMM installation order for memory sparing
		varies based on the number of processors and memory modules
		installed in the server. After an error threshold is surpassed
		in a system protected by memory sparing, the content of a failing
		rank of DIMMs is copied to the spare rank. The failing rank is
		then taken offline and the spare rank placed online for use as
		active memory in place of the failed rank.

		The sysfs attributes nodes for a repair feature are only
		present if the parent driver has implemented the corresponding
		attr callback function and provided the necessary operations
		to the EDAC device driver during registration.

		In some states of system configuration (e.g. before address
		decoders have been configured), memory devices (e.g. CXL)
		may not have an active mapping in the main host address
		physical address map. As such, the memory to repair must be
		identified by a device specific physical addressing scheme
		using a device physical address(DPA). The DPA and other control
		attributes to use will be presented in related error records.

Description:

		Nibble mask identifies one or more nibbles in error on the
		memory bus that produced the error event. Nibble Mask bit 0
		shall be set if nibble 0 on the memory bus produced the
		event, etc. For example, CXL PPR and sparing, a nibble mask
		bit set to 1 indicates the request to perform repair
		operation in the specific device. All nibble mask bits set
		to 1 indicates the request to perform the operation in all
		devices. For CXL memory to repiar, the specific value of
		nibble mask to use will be provided in related error records.

Description:
		(RW) The control attributes associated with memory address
		that is to be repaired. The specific value of attributes to
		use depends on the portion of memory to repair and will be
		reported in related error records.

		channel - The channel of the memory to repair. Channel is
		defined as an interface that can be independently accessed
		for a transaction.
		rank - The rank of the memory to repair. Rank is defined as a
		set of memory devices on a channel that together execute a
		transaction.
		bank_group - The bank group of the memory to repair.
		bank - The bank number of the memory to repair.
		row - The row number of the memory to repair.
		column - The column number of the memory to repair.
		sub_channel - The sub-channel of the memory to repair.

		The requirement to set these attributes varies based on the
		repair function. The attributes in sysfs are not present
		unless required for a repair function.
		For example, CXL spec ver 3.1, Section 8.2.9.7.1.2 Table 8-103
		soft PPR and Section 8.2.9.7.1.3 Table 8-104 hard PPR operations,
		these attributes are not required to set.
		For example, CXL spec ver 3.1, Section 8.2.9.7.1.4 Table 8-105
		memory sparing, these attributes are required to set based on
		memory sparing granularity as follows.
		Channel: Channel associated with the DPA that is to be spared
		and applies to all subclasses of sparing (cacheline, bank,
		row and rank sparing).
		Rank: Rank associated with the DPA that is to be spared and
		applies to all subclasses of sparing.
		Bank & Bank Group: Bank & bank group are associated with
		the DPA that is to be spared and applies to cacheline sparing,
		row sparing and bank sparing subclasses.
		Row: Row associated with the DPA that is to be spared and
		applies to cacheline sparing and row sparing subclasses.
		Column: column associated with the DPA that is to be spared
		and applies to cacheline sparing only.
		Sub-channel: sub-channel associated with the DPA that is to
		be spared and applies to cacheline sparing only.

		(WO) Initiate a dry run to query if resources are available

		attributes are set. The operation may fail if resources are
		insufficient based on the requirements of the memory device
		and repair function.
		For example, in the CXL PPR operations, the response
		regarding resource availability is returned synchronously
		to this command, which then issues a repair operation if
		resources are available.
		However, for the CXL memory sparing operation, in response
		to a query request, the device reports resource availability
		by generating a memory sparing event record with control
		attributes to be used for the memory that needs to be
		repaired. Upon receiving the memory sparing trace event,
		userspace sets the sysfs control attributes for the memory
		to be repaired and initiates a repair operation.
		1 - issue dry run.
