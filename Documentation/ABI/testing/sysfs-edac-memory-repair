Description:
		The sysfs EDAC bus devices /<dev-name>/mem_repairX subdirectory
		pertains to the memory media repair features control, such as
		PPR (Post Package Repair), memory sparing etc, where<dev-name>
		directory corresponds to a device registered with the EDAC
		device driver for the memory repair features.
		Memory sparing is a repair function that replaces a portion
		of memory (spared memory) with a portion of functional memory.
		Memory sparing has cacheline/row/bank/rank sparing
		granularities.
		The sysfs attributes nodes for a repair feature are only
		present if the parent driver has implemented the corresponding
		attr callback function and provided the necessary operations
		to the EDAC device driver during registration.

		In some states of system configuration (e.g. before address
		decoders have been configured), memory devices (e.g. CXL)
		may not have an active mapping in the main host address
		physical address map. As such, the memory to repair must be
		identified by a device specific physical addressing scheme
		using a DPA. The DPA to use will be presented in related
		error records.
