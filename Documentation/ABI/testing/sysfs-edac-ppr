Date:		Oct 2024
KernelVersion:	6.12
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		The sysfs EDAC bus devices /<dev-name>/ppr* subdirectory
		belongs to the memory media PPR (Post Package Repair) control
		feature, where <dev-name> directory corresponds to a device
		registered with the EDAC PPR driver and thus registered with
		the generic EDAC device driver.
		/ppr* belongs to either sPPR (Soft PPR) or hPPR (Hard PPR)
		feature for the memory device.
		The sysfs PPR attr nodes would be only present if PPR is
		supported.

Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RO) persist PPR modes supported in the device.
		For e.g. Hard PPR(hPPR) for a permanent row repair,
		Soft PPR(sPPR) for a temporary row repair.

What:		/sys/bus/edac/devices/<dev-name>/ppr*/repair_dpa
Date:		Oct 2024
KernelVersion:	6.12
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(WO) Starts the PPR operation for the DPA(device physical
		address) set. Return failure if resources are not available
                to perform repair.
		In some states of system configuration (e.g. before address decoders
		have been configured), memory devices (e.g. CXL) may not have an
		active mapping in the main host address physical address map.
		As such, the memory to repair must be identified by a device
		specific physical addressing scheme using a DPA. The DPA to use
		will be presented in related error records.
