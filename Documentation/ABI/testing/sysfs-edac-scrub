Description:
		The sysfs EDAC bus devices /<dev-name>/scrubX subdirectory
		belongs to an instance of memory scrub control feature,
		where <dev-name> directory corresponds to a device/memory
		region registered with the EDAC device driver for the
		scrub control feature.
		The sysfs scrub attr nodes would be present only if the
		client driver has implemented the corresponding attr
		callback function and passed in ops to the EDAC RAS feature
		driver during registration.
