Date:		Oct 2024
KernelVersion:	6.12
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		The sysfs EDAC bus devices /<dev-name>/scrub* subdirectory
		belongs to an instance of memory scrub control feature,
		where <dev-name> directory corresponds to a device/memory
		region registered with the EDAC scrub driver and thus
		registered with the generic EDAC RAS driver.
		The sysfs scrub attr nodes would be present only if the
		client driver has implemented the corresponding attr
		callback function and pass in ops to the EDAC RAS feature
		driver during registration.
