Introduction
------------
Increasing DRAM size and cost have made memory subsystem reliability an
important concern. These modules are used where potentially corrupted data
could cause expensive or fatal issues. Memory errors are among the top
hardware failures that cause server and workload crashes.

Memory scrubbing is a feature where an ECC (Error-Correcting Code) engine
reads data from each memory media location, corrects with an ECC if
necessary and writes the corrected data back to the same memory media
location.

The memory DIMMs can be scrubbed at a configurable rate to detect
uncorrected memory errors and attempt recovery from detected errors,
providing the following benefits.

* Proactively scrubbing memory DIMMs reduces the chance of a correctable error becoming uncorrectable.

* When detected, uncorrected errors caught in unallocated memory pages are isolated and prevented from being allocated to an application or the OS.

* This reduces the likelihood of software or hardware products encountering memory errors.

There are 2 types of memory scrubbing:

1. Background (patrol) scrubbing of the RAM while the RAM is otherwise
idle.

2. On-demand scrubbing for a specific address range or region of memory.

Several types of interfaces to hardware memory scrubbers have been
identified, such as CXL memory device patrol scrub, CXL DDR5 ECS, ACPI
RAS2 memory scrubbing, and ACPI NVDIMM ARS (Address Range Scrub).

The scrub control varies between different memory scrubbers. To allow
for standard userspace tooling there is a need to present these controls
with a standard ABI.

The control mechanisms vary across different memory scrubbers. To enable
standardized userspace tooling, there is a need to present these controls
through a standardized ABI.

Introduce a generic memory EDAC scrub control that allows users to manage
underlying scrubbers in the system through a standardized sysfs scrub
control interface. This common sysfs scrub control interface abstracts the
management of various scrubbing functionalities into a unified set of
functions.

Use cases of common scrub control feature
-----------------------------------------
1. Several types of interfaces for hardware (HW) memory scrubbers have
been identified, including the CXL memory device patrol scrub, CXL DDR5
ECS, ACPI RAS2 memory scrubbing features, ACPI NVDIMM ARS (Address Range
Scrub), and software-based memory scrubbers. Some of these scrubbers
support control over patrol (background) scrubbing (e.g., ACPI RAS2, CXL)
and/or on-demand scrubbing (e.g., ACPI RAS2, ACPI ARS). However, the scrub
control interfaces vary between memory scrubbers, highlighting the need for
a standardized, generic sysfs scrub control interface that is accessible to
userspace for administration and use by scripts/tools.

2. User-space scrub controls allow users to disable scrubbing if necessary,
for example, to disable background patrol scrubbing or adjust the scrub
rate for performance-aware operations where background activities need to
be minimized or disabled.

3. User-space tools enable on-demand scrubbing for specific address ranges,
provided that the scrubber supports this functionality.

4. User-space tools can also control memory DIMM scrubbing at a configurable
scrub rate via sysfs scrub controls. This approach offers several benefits:

* Detects uncorrectable memory errors early, before user access to affected memory, helping facilitate recovery.

* Reduces the likelihood of correctable errors developing into uncorrectable errors.

5. Policy control for hotplugged memory is necessary because there may not
be a system-wide BIOS or similar control to manage scrub settings for a CXL
device added after boot. Determining these settings is a policy decision,
balancing reliability against performance, so userspace should control it.
Therefore, a unified interface is recommended for handling this function in
a way that aligns with other similar interfaces, rather than creating a
separate one.

CXL Memory Scrubbing features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CXL spec r3.1 section 8.2.9.9.11.1 describes the memory device patrol scrub
control feature. The device patrol scrub proactively locates and makes
corrections to errors in regular cycle. The patrol scrub control allows the
request to configure patrol scrubber's input configurations.

The patrol scrub control allows the requester to specify the number of
hours in which the patrol scrub cycles must be completed, provided that
the requested number is not less than the minimum number of hours for the
patrol scrub cycle that the device is capable of. In addition, the patrol
scrub controls allow the host to disable and enable the feature in case
disabling of the feature is needed for other purposes such as
performance-aware operations which require the background operations to be
turned off.

Error Check Scrub (ECS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CXL spec r3.1 section 8.2.9.9.11.2 describes the Error Check Scrub (ECS)
is a feature defined in JEDEC DDR5 SDRAM Specification (JESD79-5) and
allows the DRAM to internally read, correct single-bit errors, and write
back corrected data bits to the DRAM array while providing transparency
to error counts.

The DDR5 device contains number of memory media FRUs per device. The
DDR5 ECS feature and thus the ECS control driver supports configuring
the ECS parameters per FRU.

ACPI RAS2 Hardware-based Memory Scrubbing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ACPI spec 6.5 section 5.2.21 ACPI RAS2 describes ACPI RAS2 table
provides interfaces for platform RAS features and supports independent
RAS controls and capabilities for a given RAS feature for multiple
instances of the same component in a given system.
Memory RAS features apply to RAS capabilities, controls and operations
that are specific to memory. RAS2 PCC sub-spaces for memory-specific RAS
features have a Feature Type of 0x00 (Memory).

The platform can use the hardware-based memory scrubbing feature to expose
controls and capabilities associated with hardware-based memory scrub
engines. The RAS2 memory scrubbing feature supports following as per spec,

* Independent memory scrubbing controls for each NUMA domain, identified using its proximity domain.

* Provision for background (patrol) scrubbing of the entire memory system, as well as on-demand scrubbing for a specific region of memory.

ACPI Address Range Scrubbing(ARS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ACPI spec 6.5 section 9.19.7.2 describes Address Range Scrubbing(ARS).
ARS allows the platform to communicate memory errors to system software.
This capability allows system software to prevent accesses to addresses
with uncorrectable errors in memory. ARS functions manage all NVDIMMs
present in the system. Only one scrub can be in progress system wide
at any given time.
Following functions are supported as per the specification.

1. Query ARS Capabilities for a given address range, indicates platform
supports the ACPI NVDIMM Root Device Unconsumed Error Notification.

2. Start ARS triggers an Address Range Scrub for the given memory range.
Address scrubbing can be done for volatile memory, persistent memory, or both.

3. Query ARS Status command allows software to get the status of ARS,
including the progress of ARS and ARS error record.

4. Clear Uncorrectable Error.

5. Translate SPA

6. ARS Error Inject etc.

The kernel supports an existing control for ARS and ARS is currently not
supported in EDAC.
